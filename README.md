# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a simple gui-based implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python.

## Game Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played by two players who take turns marking spaces in the grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O'). The goal of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the other player does.

This implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe provides a user-friendly interface using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Tkinter library. Players can enter their names and symbols, and the game board is displayed with buttons for each position. The game enforces the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe and declares a winner or a draw when appropriate.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
- Player input screen for entering names and symbols.
- Switching between players after each move.
- Validation of player input to ensure it's valid and follows the game rules.
- Displaying the game result (winner or draw) in a message box.
- Option to reset the game and enter new player information.
